# Code-Server-on-Docker

The repo is to store how I configure my code-server on Docker and get it run on my 64-bit Raspberry Pi and remotely/sercurely(https) access the code-server on Safari with iPad.

This is inspired by [VSCode on iPad Pro - Full Setup Guide with Raspberry Pi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11YfaGi0Fpk&t=109s), and it doesn't really matter if you are using any series of iPad product because this works fine with my iPad Air5.
